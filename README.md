# timetracker

This is a time tracker. There are many like it but this one is mine. :)

It's loosely based on a time tracker I used almost 20 years ago that was ripped from QuickBooks.

The stack is Golang + GORM. The DB is SQLite. The interface is CLI + a System tray applet.
There will be reporting, eventually.
