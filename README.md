# timetracker

This is a time tracker. There are many like it but this one is mine. :)

It's loosely based on a time tracker I used in the early 2000s that was ripped from QuickBooks.

The stack is Golang 1.16 + GORM.
The DB is SQLite.
The interface is CLI + a System tray applet (getlantern/systray) + a GL-based GUI (fyne.io).
It compiles on Linux, macOS, and probably Windows.

There will be reporting, eventually.
